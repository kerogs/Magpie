# Import profile

## Manually
If you wish to manually import a profile of your own, go to the old version of Magpie, go to ``/data/account/`` then copy the desired folder and paste it into the same folder but in the new version. And that's it. You've imported your profile. If necessary, reconnect!

## From settings
Acutally, it is not yet possible to import a profile from your new account settings. You'll have to do it manually. Don't worry, this will be added in the future.
